## Gmail Watch

The Gmail Watch trigger node allows you to watch for new emails in your inbox.

You can configure it by connecting the account of the email you want the node to watch.

Once the node is configured, it will watch for new emails in the inbox and trigger the workflow when a new email is detected. The contents of the email will be provided as input to the workflow.

NOTE: The node will only trigger the workflow if the workflow is published.

If you want the agent to use a tool, you can add a tool to the agent node.
