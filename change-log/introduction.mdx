We have now added action nodes, which allow you to automate tasks which don't require AI. These can help in workflows where you want your Agent node to receive a specific piece of data.

We have also added a sidebar in the worklfow editor which opens when you are executing a workflow. It allows you to to monitor your workflow while it's executing.
