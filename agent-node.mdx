## Agent Node

The Agent Node is an AI robot that performs a task. It needs three things:

- **Role:** The job or title you want the agent to have.
- **Context:** The background information you want the agent to know.
- **Input:** The instructions or prompt given to the agent, usually provided by the previous node.

If you want the agent to use a tool, you can add a tool to the agent node.
