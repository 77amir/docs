## Quick Knowledge

A **workflow** is a series of steps where each step (or node) does a specific task. You can share information from one step to the next by linking them together.

### Agent node

The agent node is an AI tool that performs a task. It needs three things:
- **Role:** The job or title you want the agent to have.
- **Context:** The background information you want the agent to know.
- **Input:** The instructions or prompt given to the agent, usually provided by the previous node.
- **Tool:** A resource that gives the agent extra abilities, such as sending an email or creating a Google document. Based on the task, the agent will decide whether to use the tool or not.

### Action node

The action node performs a set task automatically without using AI. It always behaves the same way. For example, the **'Excel - Detect Changes'** action node will check the connected Excel file and list any changes in the same format every time.


### Trigger node

A trigger node sets a condition to run a workflow when that condition is met. For example, the **Gmail Watch** trigger node monitors your email inbox. When a new email arrives, it automatically starts the workflow. The content of the email is then passed along as the output of the trigger node.
