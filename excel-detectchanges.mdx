## Excel

### Detect Changes

The Excel - Detect Changes action node checks the connected Excel file and lists any changes in the same format every time.

You can configure it by setting the path to the sharepoint file, the file name and the sheet name.

once configured, run the node once to load the data into the node. When you run it again, it will compare the new data with the old data and list the changes in its output.
