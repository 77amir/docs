## Scheduled Execution

The Scheduled Execution allows you to schedule the execution of a workflow at a specific time.

You can configure it by by publishing the workflow and then setting the schedule in the workflows page in the Ageno dashboard.

- **Time:** The time you want the workflow to start.
- **Frequency:** The frequency you want the workflow to run.
